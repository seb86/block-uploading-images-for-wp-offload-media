Community made patches, bug reports and contributions are always welcome and are crucial.

When contributing please ensure you follow the guidelines below so that I can keep on top of things.

__Note:__

GitHub is for *bug reports and contributions only* - if you have a support question or a request, don't post here. Use [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-offload-s3-filter-image-file-types) for community support.

## Getting Started

## Making Changes

* Make the changes to your forked repository
  * **Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards).**

* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the 'master' branch of the repository.
